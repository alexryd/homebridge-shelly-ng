## Installation

Either install this plugin through [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x)
or manually by following these instructions:

1. Install Homebridge by [following the instructions](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki).
2. Install this plugin by running `npm install -g homebridge-shelly-ng`.
3. Add this plugin to the Homebridge config.json:
  ```
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "ShellyNG",
      "name": "Shelly NG"
    }
  ]
  ```

By default, devices will be discovered on your local network using mDNS and
WebSockets will then be used to communicate with them.

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available. Note that they are all optional.

```
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "e.g. shellyplus1-abcdef123456",
      "name": "My Device",
      "exclude": false,
      "hostname": "e.g. 192.168.1.200",
      "password": "pa$$word",
      "coverType": "windowCovering"
    }
  ],
  "mdns": {
    "enable": true,
    "interface": "e.g. eth0 or 192.168.1.100"
  },
  "websocket": {
    "requestTimeout": 10,
    "pingInterval": 60,
    "reconnectInterval": [ 5, 10, 30, 60, 300, 600 ]
  }
}
```

See below for descriptions of each configuration option.

| Option                          | Description |
| ---                             | ---         |
| `devices`                       | An array of one or more objects with options for specific devices. |
| `devices. id`                   | The device ID. [Here's how to find it](https://github.com/alexryd/homebridge-shelly-ng/wiki/Finding-a-device-ID). |
| `devices. name`                 | The name of the device. This will be shown in the homebridge log and will be used as the default name when the device is added to HomeKit. Note though that setting this value after the device has been added will not change the name in HomeKit. If no name is specified, this plugin will use the device name set in the Shelly app, or the name of the device model. |
| `devices. exclude`              | Set this value to `true` to make this plugin ignore this device. |
| `devices. hostname`             | The IP address or hostname of the device. Set this value if your device can't be discovered automatically. |
| `devices. password`             | The password to use if authentication has been enabled for the device.
| `devices. coverType`             | The type of device that is shown in Homekit, when the Shelly is in cover mode. Possible values: "awning, "door", "window", "windowCovering" |
| `mdns`                          | Settings for the mDNS device discovery service. |
| `mdns. enable`                  | Set this value to `false` to disable automatic device discovery using mDNS. |
| `mdns. interface`               | The network interface to use when sending and receiving mDNS packets. You probably don't need to use this setting unless you know what you're doing. If not specified, all available network interfaces will be used. |
| `websocket. requestTimeout`     | The time, in seconds, to wait for a response before a request is aborted. |
| `websocket. pingInterval`       | The interval, in seconds, at which ping requests should be made to verify that the connection is open. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `websocket. reconnectInterval`  | The interval, in seconds, at which a connection attempt should be made after a socket has been closed. If an array or a comma-separated list of numbers is specified, the first value will be used for the first connection attempt, the second value for the second attempt and so on. When the last value has been reached, it will be used for all subsequent connection attempts; unless the value is `0`, in which case no more attempts will be made. Set to `0` to disable. |
